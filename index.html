            <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
            <p>Using historical data of NBA players, we look to minimize the risk for front offices who are looking to offer
                contracts to free agents.  This past data is one of many factors that can be used to
                 help predict the likelihood that a player's health will hold up for the entirety of their contract.
